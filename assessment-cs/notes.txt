Insert Function (.unshift):

mediumArray: 221.437 μs
largeArray: 13.673246 ms
extraLargeArray: 1.918361422 s

Append Function (.push): 
tinyArray: 133.544 μs
smallArray: 153.896 μs
mediumArray: 267.394 μs
largeArray: 714.094 μs
extraLargeArray: 4.212774 ms

Based on the results above, the append function seems to scale better compared to the insert function. In three of the five tests, the append function was faster than the insert function. 

This insert function is slower because it uses the .unshift method which puts the number at the start of the array. To move the number to the beginning of the array it has to move it one by one until its at the start of the array. Depending on the length of the array, it can take awhile as we see in the resutls.
